# character-sheet

A small template game for getting started with JS game development using 
Mozilla's gladius library.

# Development Setup

1. Clone the repo recursively: `git clone --recursive git://github.com/Osmose/character-sheet.git`
2. Make sure you have a recent version of `node` installed (>= 0.6). See 
   [here](http://nodejs.org/) for details on how to do this for your platform.
3. Install `jake` using `npm`. Gladius docs say to do this globally, but I've
   only been able to get this working with a local install: `npm install jake`.

To preview the demo or run your game:

1. `jake serve`
2. Visit http://localhost:8080
